But a bearing failure and lack of support (due to machinery shortages caused by WWII) caused maintenance to be overlooked. When the turbine was restarted in 1945 this lack of maintenance led to a catastrophic blade failure and the project never recovered. California Wind Turbines 1980\\u2019s. Smith-Putnam MW Turbine.
