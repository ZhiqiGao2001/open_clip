House baked scones and sweets share a plate. Vineyard Cafe's secret recipe honey cream spread perfectly complemented their just-right scones in cranberry-orange, blueberry and cinnamon (our favorite) . Dessert included a cream puff and two homemade cookies that were a nice blend of soft, chewy and sweet. We agreed the cherry almond cupcake earned our top dessert vote.
