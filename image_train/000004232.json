Sure, the white-painted front bumper and circular emblems can be deleted for free, but this Porsche fan prefers the pageantry, however silly it may appear. Besides, the alternative paint colors are just as gaudy. I'd also choose the Satin Platinum wheels and the $2900 black-trimmed LED headlights for a more sinister look.",
